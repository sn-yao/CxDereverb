The GUI can be launched by running “welcomePage.m” in CxDereverb_basic floder. The initial screen prompts users to select a stereo audio file. A demo audio file named “Default.wav” is included with the toolkit. After selecting the audio file, users are required to input the sampling frequency and specify the frequency range of their loudspeakers. They must also set the ridge parameter based on the ambient noise level. Upon pressing “Next,” the room impulse response and inverse filter are computed and saved as “ir.mat” and “inv.mat”, respectively. The final screen displays the result of the dereverberation process.
The “MyAppInstaller_web.exe” file in the Cx_Dereverb_exe folder is intended for users who do not have MATLAB installed.
